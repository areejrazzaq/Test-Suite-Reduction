# Tool Support
A set of custom developed javascript tools to speed up and assist in reasearch activities  
## Descriptions
### datasetGenerator.js
This tools generates a dataset from mutode2 output of a npm package. It will generate all possible combinations of test cases and would insert rows with 0 or 1 at corresponding indices of test case number. 0 indicates a test case is picked and 1 indicates it was dropped for this particular sample. Each row has an output which is the mutation score acheived by the selected test cases. It will generate an output.csv file  
`node datasetGenerator.js <path to csv output from mutode>`

### combinationScorer.js
Generates all possible combinations of test cases, seperates combinations of same sizes into collections and then for each collection picks randomly at most 10 combinations and returns their maximum, minimum and average mutation score. Generates an output.txt file  
`node combinationScorer.js <path to csv output from mutode>`  

### testRename.js
This package will rename test cases and append them with their number. Test cases are renamed inplace so backup the test folder before running this script. This script is not genralized to every package,some packages still need a little manual naming, and it does not work in cases where dynamic tests are generated.  
`node testRename.js <path to test folder of npm package>`

### stringMaker.js
Given a csv string of test case number, generates a regex string that can then be used with mocha to run only selective tests. If mutode2 output file is also given as a parameter two strings are returned one containing only test case number and other only names  
`node stringMaker.js <testCaseNumbersSeperatedByComma> {<mutode2 output file for the test case> escape}`

### correlations.py
This python script takes a dataset file generated by datasetGenerator.js and return 'n' most correlated test cases w.r.t mutation scores.  
`python correlations.py <path to dataset file> <no of test cases to be picked (n)>`
